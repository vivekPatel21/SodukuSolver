## SodukuSolver :pencil2:

This reads input files for soduku boards, and than looks for the solution to the sodoku board through backtracking and looking through many different versions of the board.

The overall time complexity of the program is O(n^2), this is mainly due to backtracking, so depending on the difficulty of the board, it may take a bit longer. 
This should not be too much of a problem however, because this is Soduku and the boards cannot get to an unreasonably large number.

To test this file you may want to look inside the Soduku test files in order to make sure that the board you create can be solved by the program.
